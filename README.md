This project is being really hard for me, but I'm doing my best.

First I added the eventListener to the button "generate password"

Then I created my arrays for lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters variables.

I created a temporary password variable.

Then comes the generate password function, which first will give the user first prompt to define a number of characters
they want their password to be.

Then I have a variable named ran that makes the random print in all my diferent arrays, if the user confirms each array.
